This is a little 2-player local multiplayer gamejam game that @nornagon and I wrote in a day.

You need 2x gamepad controllers (though nornagon wants to make everything work
with the keyboard). I've been developing with a couple wired xbox 360
controllers in chrome on macos. (You don't need any drivers or anything.)
